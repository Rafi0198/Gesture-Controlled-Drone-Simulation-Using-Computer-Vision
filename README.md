# Gesture-Controlled-Drone-Simulation-Using-Computer-Vision
The drone is controlled using different hand gestures, with real-time hand tracking powered by OpenCV and Mediapipe. The estimated hand landmarks are processed to generate the control commands which is then sent to the simulated drone. The flight control is handled via DroneKit on a simulated environment using SITL and ArduPilot.
